				<div class="about-book">
					<p>ANSI C, ISO C and Standard C are successive standards for the C programming language published by
						the
						American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for
						Standardization
                        (ISO).</p> <br>
                        
                        <p>Historically, the names referred specifically to the original and best-supported version
						of
						the standard (known as C89 or C90). Software developers writing in C are encouraged to conform
						to
						the standards, as doing so helps portability between compilers.</p>

				<h3>Data Structures</h3>
				<div class="book" id="book4"> </div>
				<div class="about-book">
					<p>This book is also useful for Engineering degree students and Masters degree students duringtheir
                       academic  preparations.  In  all  the  chapters  you  will  see  that  there  is  more  emphasis
                       onproblems and their analysis rather than on theory. In each chapter, you will first read about 
                       thebasic required theory, which is then followed by a section on problem sets. In total, there 
                       areapproximately 700 algorithmic problems, all with solutions.If  you  read  the  book  as  a student
                       preparing  for  competitive  exams  for  Computer  Science  /Information Technology, the content 
                       covers all the required topics in full detail. While writingthis book, my main focus was to help
                       students who are preparing for these exams.

				<h3>Computer System Architecutre</h3>
				<div class="book" id="book5"> </div>
				<div class="about-book">
					<p> This book deals with computer architecture as well as computer organization
                        and design. Computer architecture is concerned with the structure and behavior
                         of the various functional modules of the computer and how they interact
                        to provide the processing needs of the user. Computer organization is concerned with
                         the way the hardware components are connected together to form
                        a computer system. Computer design is concerned with the development of
                        the hardware for the computer taking into consideration a given set of specifJCations</p>
					<p>Dealing with computer architecture as well as computer organization and design, this fully
                         updated book provides the basic knowledge necessary to understand the hardware operation
                          of digital computers. Written to aid electrical engineers, computer engineers, and computer 
                          scientists, the volume includes: KEY FEATURES: the computer architecture, organization, and
                           design associated with computer hardware • the various digital components used in the organization 
                           and design of digital computers • detailed steps that a designer must go through in order to design 
                           an elementary basic computer • the organization and architecture of the central processing unit • 
                           the organization and architecture of input-output and memory • the concept of multiprocessing • 
                           two new chapters on pipeline and vector processing • two sections devoted completely to the reduced
                            instruction set computer (RISC) • and sample worked-out problems to clarify topics.</p>
